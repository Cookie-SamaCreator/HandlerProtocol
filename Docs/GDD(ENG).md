🎮 GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT — Handler Protocol

🧩 1. Pitch
Handler Protocol is an asymmetrical cooperative multiplayer FPS.
 Objective: Escort a volatile artifact to an extraction point while surviving increasingly powerful enemy waves.
The team is composed of two distinct roles:
Ciphers — elite augmented soldiers operating on the field.


The Handler — a tactical intelligence that supervises and supports them through a command drone.


Together, they must coordinate their strengths to complete the mission, balancing combat, strategy, and resource management.

⚙️ 2. Core Concept
The game is built on asymmetrical cooperation:
Ciphers act directly on the ground, fighting enemies and transporting the objective.


The Handler observes, analyzes, and influences the battle from a first-person view inside their tactical drone, interacting with the battlefield in real time.


Core gameplay pillars:
 → Communication • Tension • Role synergy

🎯 3. Main Objective
Escort an unstable energy artifact to its extraction point.
Enemies attempt to destroy or capture the carrier.
 The team must:
Protect the carrier


Manage ammunition and resources


Survive adaptive enemy waves


Complete secondary objectives to unlock Handler support abilities



🧠 4. Playable Roles

⚔️ The Ciphers
Augmented soldiers synchronized with their Handler.
 Each Cipher offers a distinct playstyle inspired by classic combat roles.
View:
Immersive FPS


Fast, clear combat readability


Emphasis on coordination and complementarity

Vision / infiltration
Optical camouflage, motion sensor, target marker

Each Cipher features a modular kit and unique visual identity (armor, visor, lighting effects aligned with their role).

🧭 The Handler
A key player embodying a sentient tactical intelligence connected to the battlefield through a first-person command drone.
View:
FPS through the tactical drone


Limited aerial mobility (altitude and range)


Enhanced vision: detection, thermal scan, audio signals


Role:
Oversees and supports Ciphers


Activates support abilities via an energy-based resource system


Interacts with the environment (hacking, scanning, deploying decoys or turrets)


Engages with the world through hacking and network management mini-games



🧬 5. Handler Archetypes
Name
Specialty
Style
Core Abilities
ARCHON
Strike / Control
Military, authoritarian
Orbital strike, weapon jammer, damage boost
FABER
Logistics / Defense
Engineer, protector
Turrets, repair drones, supply drops
SYNTHEX
Analysis / Prediction
Observer, analytical
Neural scan, trajectory prediction, cooldown boost
VOID
Sabotage / Distortion
Mystic, unstable
Mind control, slow field, total interference

Each Handler operates a visually distinct drone and holographic interface.
 Abilities consume Protocol Energy, which is replenished through successful Cipher actions.

💡 6. Asymmetrical Cooperative Gameplay
Gameplay Loop:
Deployment → The Handler selects the team’s insertion point.


Escort → Ciphers advance while fighting waves of enemies.


Support → The Handler provides boosts, healing, information, or precision strikes.


Adaptive Threat → Enemies evolve dynamically (speed, numbers, special traits).


Final Extraction → Defend the area until the transport arrives.


Secondary Objectives:
Hacking points, communication relays, data beacons.


Completing these grants new powers for the Handler or upgrades Cipher equipment.



🔄 7. Progression
Class-based XP: Each Cipher and Handler levels up independently.


Unlock new equipment, abilities, and Handler profiles.


Cosmetic customization system for armor and drones.



🧱 8. Technical Structure (Unity)
System
Description
Networking
Framework: Unity Netcode for GameObjects or Photon Fusion (depending on performance)
Gameplay
FPS Controller (Ciphers) + Drone Controller (Handler)
AI System
Adaptive enemies using NavMesh and modular behaviors
UI
Holographic HUD, tactical minimap, ping system
Map Design
Corridors and open defense zones (inspired by extraction or payload maps)


🎨 9. Art Direction
Setting: Futuristic / techno-military.


Mood: Mix of clean tech (holographic interfaces, smooth surfaces, white light) and industrial chaos (battle zones, decaying tech ruins).


Color palette: Cold blues, purples, electric oranges.


Inspiration: Evolve, The Division, Deus Ex.



🔊 10. Sound Design
Synthetic voices, network echoes, data corruption effects.


Dynamic musical themes adapting to combat intensity.


Tactical comms feedback: “Handler online,” “Cipher down,” etc.



🌐 11. Narrative Identity
In a future where human consciousness is integrated into military networks,
 the Handlers are the augmented minds of former strategists,
 commanding Ciphers, soldiers synchronized to their neural frequency.
Together, they execute The Protocol — humanity’s last line of defense against extinction.
